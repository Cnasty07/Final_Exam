# Final Exam Project by Chris Nastasi


### Important

- while the db connection works I commented it out in index file because I did not want to actually store data into the cluster used for the project.


### Description 

- app works by calculating the bmi but then posting on form submit.
- form submit then redirects back to home page but saves the data(currently commented out) to atlas db
- parameters passed through route are the bmi
